    "These days, machine learning and deep neural networks are exploding in importance. These fields are so popular that even a cave man might have heard it once. The exaggeration not withstanding, there is perhaps no necessity to justify the topic for today's blog post: exploring a machine learning algorithm by building it from scratch. Apparently, \"from scratch\" is now a trendy pedagogical methodology employed in many websites and resources that claim to educate their readers about machine learning. To this, I agree: by constructing algorithms from the ground up, one can glean meaningful insights about how machine learning actually works. At the same time, however, I feel ambivalent because real-life practice requires us to be knowledgable about popular libraries and modules. This is why I see today's post---building the k-nearest neighbors algorithm from scratch---as being just one side of the picture, the other side being the exploration of how to use popular libraries such as `sklearn` to implement machine learning. \n",

    "As the name implies, the [k-nearest neighbors algorithm] works by findinng the nearest neighbors of some give data. Then, it looks at the labels of $k$ neighboring points to produce a classification prediction. Here, $k$ is a parameter that we can tweak to build the KNN model. For instance, let's say we have a binary classification problem. If we set $k$ to 10, the KNN modell will look for 10 nearest points to the data presented. If among the 10 neighbors observed, 8 of them have the label 0 and 2 of them are labeled 1, the KNN algorithm will conclude that the label of the provided data is most likely also going to be 0. As we can see, the KNN algorithm is extremely simple, but if we have enough data to feed it, it can produce some highly accurate predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are still missing pieces to this puzzle, such as how to find the nearest neighbors, but we will explore the specifics of the algorithm on the go as we build the model from scratch.

    "The plot shows that accuracy is maximized for many values of $k$, not just 1. Also, we can learn that accuracy does not go beyond the 97 percent we saw earlier, which is a bit of sad news. An interesting insight we can glean, however, is that accuracy seems to drop past some certain thresholds, most notably around 80. One reasonable explanation might be that the model is looking at too many neighbors that it cannot produce a reliable estimate. At any rate, this visualization shows that hyperparameter tuning is an important job of a machine learning engineer---even if the model is great, if the wrong $k$ value is used, the model will only demonstrate lackluster performance."

    "This was perhaps the first post where we dealt with a machine learning algorithm. ML is sometimes treated as a black box, where some magic beneath the hood produces desirable results. However, I find exploring these mechanisms a lot more interesting than simply using pre-existing modules and libraries, as important as they may be. Hopefully, this post gave you some idea of how the KNN model works. \n",
    "\n",
    "I plan to post more on machine learning algorithms in the future, because I find the idea of building models from scratch to be interesting and valuable. However, as stated earlier, other posts will deal with libraries to help demonstrate how machine learning models are used in practice; after all, most practitioners don't build the model themselves every time they embark on a project. The bottom line is that we find a sweet spot and become skilled at both. \n",
