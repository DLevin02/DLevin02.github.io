A few months ago, we explored the topic of Markov Chain Monte Carlo and its variant, Metropolis-Hastings. Recently, I came across a similar MCMC-based sampling algorithm, Gibbs sampling, that I thought was both intuitive and interesting. In this post, we will take a look at how Gibbs sampling works, then use R and Python to implement this algorithm given a dummy example. 

# Motivation

The motivation for MCMC-based sampling algorithms is simple: in a Bayesian context, we might be dealing with some intractable posterior distribution that is difficult to estimate. In Metrapolis-Hastings, we

Sys.setenv(RETICULATE_PYTHON = "/Users/jaketae/opt/anaconda3/envs/basic/bin/python")
library('reticulate')
```


```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
