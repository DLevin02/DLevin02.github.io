Notice that this creates an internal loop within the graph. In graph theory language, this is known as a strongly connected component, and we might explore this topic in a future post. For now, we can understand them as a loop, the implication of which is that there are now multiple ways to get from one node to another via that loop. "

    "The idea is pretty simple: in `to_visit`, we keep track of nodes to visit. These nodes obviously live in the same level. Then, we loop hrough this list of nodes. If the node is not `None`, we add its value to a temporary list within the `while` loop, denoted as `values`. When we are done traversing the nodes in that level, we append the accumulated results of `value` to `visited`. We also keep track of the next layer via `next_nodes`. This `next_nodes` contains the nodes to visit in the next iteration, so it become sthe new `to_visit`. In the next iteration, we repeat what we have done on the `next_nodes` list until there is no more nodes to traverse, *i.e.* we are at the leaf nodes. "

This is the outer-layer comparison, represented as `[left.left, right.right]`. For an inner layer comparison, we need to check if the value of the right child of the left node is equal to that of the left child of the right node. This corresponds to `[left.right, right.left]`. In the example above, for instance, we need to check that `4` and `4` are equal, and also that `3` and `3` are equal in the outer most leaf nodes.

    "In this post, we looked at BFS and DFS algorithms. These algorithms are very useful for traversing a tree structure. A generalization of DFS, for example, is the backtracking algorithm, which is often used to solve many problems. Although there is nothing special about DFS and BFS in that they are essentially brute force methods of search, they are nonetheless powerful tools that can be used to tackle countless tasks. It's also just good exercise with Python.\n",
