[This SO thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48915810/pytorch-contiguous) gives a nice explanation of what it means for tensors to be contiguous; the bottom line is that, some operations, such `.t()`, do not create a completely new tensor, but returns a tensor that shares the data with the original tensor while having different index locations for each element.

In the example below in which we concatenate along the first dimension, the brackets are those that form the boundary of the inner two-dimensional 3-by-4 tensor. Let's take a look."

    "In this post, we took a look at some useful tensor manipulation operations and techniques. Although I do have some experience using Keras and TensorFlow, I never felt confident in my ability to deal with tensors, as that felt more low-level. PyTorch, on the other hand, provides a nice combination of high-level and low-level features. Tensor operation is definitely more on the low-level side, but I like this part of PyTorch because it forces me to think more about things like input and the model architecture.\n",
