    "For a very long time, I've been fascinated by sequence-to-sequence models. Give the model a photo as input, it spits out a caption to go along with it; give it some English text, it can translate it into another language. Seq2seq models are also not only widely applicable in different contexts, but it also arguably laid the groundwork for other more advanced models that came after, such as attention and transformers. In studying seq2seq models, I found Ben Trevett's [sequence modeling tutorials](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq) extremely helpful. In particular, this post is heavily based off of [this notebook](https://github.com/bentrevett/pytorch-seq2seq/blob/master/1%20-%20Sequence%20to%20Sequence%20Learning%20with%20Neural%20Networks.ipynb).

    "\n",
    "The end goal of this tutorial was to gain a deeper understanding of how encoder-decoder sequence-to-sequence models are implemented. I remember reading about neural machine translation through the TensorFlow website around a year ago when I was first learning deep learning with Keras, and it's just great to see that I've made enough progress to be able to understand, digest, and model a basic sequence-to-sequence NMT model with PyTorch. \n",
    "\n",
    "But again, the model we have implemented today is extremely simple in terms of its design, and there are many more enhancements we can apply to it. In the coming posts, we will be taking a look at some better, more advanced seq2seq models that implement features like attention. \n",
