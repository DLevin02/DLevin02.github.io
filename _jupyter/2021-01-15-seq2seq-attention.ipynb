    "Attention took the NLP community by storm a few years ago when it was first announced. I've personally heard about attention many times, but never had the chance to fully dive into what it was. In this post, we will attempt to bake in a simple attention mechanism into a seq2seq model. This post builds on top of the seq2seq-related topics we have been exploring last month. Without further ado, let's jump right in!\n",

This is different from the vanilla seq2seq model, where the final encoding output is only available at the first time step and is diluted throughout the decoding process. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the fact that the encoding output should still contain all relevant information from the input remains unchanged. This could be a problem if, say, the input is an extremely long sequence. In that case, we cannot reasonably expect $z$ to be able to contain all information from the input without non-trivial loss. This is where attention comes to the rescue!"

    "The most salient advantage of using attention is that, with attention, the decoder now has access to all the hidden states of the encoder. So instead of generating a highly compact, compressed version of the input via the encoder output $z$, instead the decoder can now \"see\" all the hidden states from the encoder and pay attention to the hidden states that matter most. Intuitively, this makes a lot of sense: in a machine translation setting, for example, the decoder should attend to \"guten\" when translating \"good\" and pay lesser attention to \"morgen.\" The end goal here is that the seq2seq model can learn some correspondence between some tokens and others in the input and output sequence; in other words, understand the syntactic difference between different languages. \n",

The underlying question is this: when some information is encoded via the encoder, then decoded by the decoder, can the decoder learn which part of the encoding to focus on while decoding? An easy real-life example of this would be machine translation. Given the input \"I love you,\" the Korean translation would be \"나는 너를 사랑해,\" or, translated word by word \"I you love.\" In this particular instance, the decoder has to know that there is some syntactic difference between Korean and English, and know which part of the original English sequence to focus on when producing a translation. \n",

    "Well, this observation is only superficially true. Recall that the main improvement we have implemented in this model is the attention of the attention mechanism, which is currently a sub-component of the decoder. Therefore, this seq2seq model properly uses attention to generate predictions at each decoding time step. "

    "In this post, we explored how attention works, and how one can bake attention into a sequence-to-sequence model. The part that I find most interesting about attention is that it makes so much intuitive sense: when we translate from one language to another, we pay attention to both the overall meaning from the source text as well as the rough one-to-one correspondence between words in source and target languages. Obviously, there are simplifications; most often, humans not only look at individual words or tokens, but also consume phrases or other chunks in the syntax tree. Since this simple seq2seq model has notion of a tree or any hierarchical structure, it can only look at token-to-token correspondence in source and target languages: one time step corresponds to one token. Perhaps in a future post, we will take a look at such more advanced attention mechanisms. \n",
