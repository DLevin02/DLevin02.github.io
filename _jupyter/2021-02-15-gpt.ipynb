    "These days, I'm exploring the field of natural language generation, using auto-regressive models such as GPT-2. HuggingFace transformers offers a host of pretrained language models, many of which can be used off the shelf with minimal fine-tuning. In this post, however, we will try to build a small GPT model from scratch using PyTorch. I've realized that sometimes I feel eerily insecure about using things without truly understanding how they work. This post is an attempt at understanding the GPT model. Turns out that its implementation is actually quite similar to the transformers implementation I wrote about in an earlier post, so you will see some repeats here and there. Also helpful was Karpathy's [minGPT](https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT) repository, which I heavily referenced for this particular implementation. With that sorted, let's get started!"

Instead of having a dedicated trainable positional embedding layer, we can simply register a lookup matrix as a positional embedding layer of sorts, then simply slice the matrix up to the appropriate sequence length, depending on the length of the input. I think is a more elegant way of implementing positional embedding than calling `torch.range()` on each forward pass, which is what would have been required had we followed the embedding layer approach.\n",

In a decoder, however, the tokens are only connected to other tokens that came before it in the input sequence. \n",

    "In this post, we took a look at how the transformer decoder works, using a mini GPT model as an example. Note that the GPT model all have a pretty similar architecture; the only difference lies in the size of the model and the dataset corpus on which it was trained. Obviously, larger models require larger datasets. \n",

These include models like the Reformer, which applied clever modifications to the algorithm to optimize it down to linear runtime, or new notions of embeddings, such as relative positional embeddings. We will explore these topics in future posts. \n",
