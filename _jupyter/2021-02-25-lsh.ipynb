    "These days, I've found myself absorbed in the world of memory-efficient transformer architectures. Transformer models require $O(n^2)$ runtime and memory due to how self-attention is implemented. Namely, each token has to be attended with every other token in the sequence, and the results must be stored in a square attention matrix, to which we apply a softmax activation to obtain the weights to multiply the values with. \n",
    "\n",
    "So far, many researchers have presented various ways of optimizing this computation while decreasing the algorithm down to linear runtime. Such architectures include the [Linformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04768), [Reformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04451), [Performer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14794), [LongFormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.05150), and more recently, the [Nystr√∂mformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.03902). My knowledge base is way too shallow to be able to read these papers on my own. Thankfully, there are heros like [Yannic Kilcher](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZHmQk67mSJgfCCTn7xBfew) who help make trendy deep learning papers a lot more accessible, even for novices like myself. I cannot recommend his channel enough.\n",

This is intended as a beginner-friendly introduction to this topic; I hope other readers can get a sense of what it is and have a better time understanding how the Reformer architecture works. As supplements, I also suggest that you check out this [medium article](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-locality-sensitive-hashing-49f6d1f6134) as well as [this blog post](https://santhoshhari.github.io/Locality-Sensitive-Hashing/), both of which I referenced in writing this post.\n",

    "Imagine that you are building a music identification service like [Shazam](https://www.shazam.com). You probably have a huge database of songs. Whenever a user plays a song, the engine should be able to conduct some sort of scan through the database to find which row best matches the song that is being played by the user. We can imagine, for instance, that the entire database is a matrix, and that each song is a vectorized row. We would some kind of distance metric, like cosine similarity, to determine how well a given song matches the user query.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a relatively small database, a linear scan could work. However, when there are millions and billions of songs, perhaps that's not the best implementation. If each song is encoded as a high-dimensional vector, perhaps a multiplication involving trillion-by-million matrix is not really tractable in computational terms. One thing we could do to remedy this is to use a dimensionality reduction technique, like PCA. We can also try to do some clustering or bucketing.\n",

More concretely, we can come up with $k$ random vectors, and project each data point to each of these vectors. If, for example, the dot product between the $i$th random vector and a data point is positive, then we encode that information by having the $i$th index of the resulting hashed representation as 1; if it is zero or a negative value, we denote it as 0. At the end of the day, each data point would thus be mapped to a binary vector of length $k$. \n",

    "Locality sensitive hashing can be used in many places. The music identification engine is an obvious one, where we would basically hash songs in the database into buckets. Then, we would perform the same hashing on the user input, see which bucket it lands on, and only query those candidates within the same bucket. This greatly reduces the number of linear scanning that has to take place. \n",

    "In the context of the transformer architecture, researchers who developed Reformer reduced the number of computations needed to produce the attention matrix, by basically binning the key and query vectors into appropriate buckets, and performing self-attention only within those buckets. This exploits the fact that the weighted value vector only largely depends on keys with high attention coefficients, since the softmax tends to squash lesser values and augments larger ones. This is a very cursory explanation of how the Reformer optimizes attention calculation; we will probably explore this in a separate blog post. \n",
