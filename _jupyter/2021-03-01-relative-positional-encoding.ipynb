    "# Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're already familiar with transformers, you probably know that transformers process inputs in parallel at once. This is one of the many reasons why transformers have been immensely more successful than RNNs: RNNs are unable to factor in long-range dependencies due to their recurrent structure, whereas transformers do not have this problem since they can see the entire sequence as it is being processed. However, this also means that transformers require positional encodings to inform the model about where specific tokens are located in the context of a full sequence. Otherwise, transformer would be entirely invariant to sequential information, considering \"John likes cats\" and \"Cats like John\" as identical. Hence, positional encodings are used to signal the absolute position of each token. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Relative Positional Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "While absolute positional encodings work reasonably well, there have also been efforts to exploit pairwise, relative positional information. In [Self-Attention with Relative Position Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.02155.pdf), Shaw et al. introduced a way of using pairwise distances as a way of creating positional encodings. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of reasons why we might want to use relative positional encodings instead of absolute ones. First, using absolute positional information necessarily means that there is a limit to the number of tokens a model can process. Say a language model can only encode up to 1024 positions. This necessarily means that any sequence longer than 1024 tokens cannot be processed by the model. Using relative pairwise distances can more gracefully solve this problem, though not without limitations. Relative positional encodings can generalize to sequences of unseen lengths, since theoretically the only information it encodes is the relative pairwise distance between two tokens. "

Basically, we pad $Q E_r^\\top$ to the left, then reshape to shift all indices, then slice out the necessary portion of the matrix to obtain $Q R^\\top$, or $S_{rel}$. This has the benefit of reducing the memory requirement; since we don't have to calculate $R$ and can instead directly use $E_r$, which is a matrix that is needed anyway, the memory requirement is reduced to $O(Ld)$.
