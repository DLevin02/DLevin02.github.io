# My Machine Learning journey
Welcome to my blog! I'm embarking on a journey to learn Machine Learning, and I'm excited to share my experiences here. Follow me as I explore the world of Machine Learning algorithms and technologies!

# My First Steps
I'm starting my journey by exploring the fundamentals of Machine Learning. I'm brushing up on my math and programming skills, and I'm getting familiar with the different types of algorithms and techniques. I'm also reading up on the latest Machine Learning research.

# My Next Steps
My next steps involve diving deeper into the various techniques and algorithms. I'm also exploring different types of Machine Learning tools and libraries, and I'm working on some basic projects to get hands-on experience.

# Update 01/01/2023:
My first update: I have started this blog a little bit late as I am in the Sequential Models Course of Andrew Ngâ€™s Deep Learning Specialization. Today I got bored of watching lectures and wanted to code so I implemented MNIST with TensorFlow. I watched the first Stanford CS244N Lecuture on NLP and realized that I just need to write code so I went through a build a house price prediction model for a Kaggle Competition.
