# Introduction
Welcome to this week's digest of AI news. We've seen significant strides in technology, with innovations like 3D dog reconstruction from a single image and the continued economic impact projections of generative AI. Yet, it's not all smooth sailing as Google faces privacy hurdles in the EU, and legal practitioners grapple with the challenges posed by AI in law. Let's delve into these stories and more as we explore the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence.

As a someone who has deeply involved in the 3D AI realm with make work on Heymesh.ai, it thrills me to witness such significant breakthroughs. We find ourselves at a crossroads in history, where regulation bears the potential to either impede or accelerate the progress of AI. Thus, it is of paramount importance that lawmakers make informed, thoughtful decisions, enabling both the safety and continued evolution of Artificial Intelligence.

# 1. BITE: A New Breakthrough for 3D Dog Pose Reconstruction

A research team from ETH Zurich, the Max Planck Institute, and IMATI-CNR Italy has unveiled BITE (Body Interaction & Tactile Engagement), a new technique that can accurately reconstruct a dog's 3D shape and pose from just a single image. Even complex poses, like sitting or lying down, can be accurately represented. This marks a significant advancement in the field, as previous methods struggled with such complex poses due to a lack of 3D training data. BITE leverages ground contact information to regress 3D dogs from a single RGB image. The innovation is further enriched with a new parametric 3D dog shape model, the D-SMAL, which can represent a wide array of breeds and mixed breeds.[Read More.](https://bite.is.tue.mpg.de/?utm_source=marktechpost-newsletter.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=ai-news-discover-openllama-13b-tapir-mime-infinigen-seal-bite-and-webglm-the-groundbreaking-models-revolutionizing-computer-vision-and-ai-learning-from-top-global-researchers)

# 2. Google's Bard AI EU Launch Delayed Over Privacy Concerns

Google has been forced to delay the European Union launch of its Bard AI due to privacy concerns. The Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) raised these concerns, leading to an ongoing examination of Bard. The generative AI was set to launch in the EU this week, but the IDPC hadn't received a detailed privacy briefing, data impact assessment, or supporting information. Other AI developers, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, are also facing scrutiny in the EU.

# 3. Lawyers: Beware LLMs

In a recent case, a U.S. federal judge rejected a legal brief generated by ChatGPT. The attorney who used ChatGPT to create the brief faces disciplinary action after it was discovered the brief referred to fictional cases and quotes invented by the bot. In response to this case, a federal judge in Texas decreed that lawyers in cases before him may only use generative AI to write their briefs if they manually verify the output for accuracy. This case serves as a cautionary tale for the use of AI in sensitive fields like law, where accuracy and reliability are paramount.

# 4. Economic Forecast: GenAI Boom

A new report by management consultancy McKinsey projects that generative AI could add between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion to the global economy annually. This represents roughly 2 percent to 4 percent of the worldâ€™s combined gross domestic product. The authors examined adoption scenarios between 2040 and 2060, their effect on labor productivity through 2040, and the business impact of generative AI use cases. Despite these prospective economic gains, the technology's potential to displace human workers is causing substantial public anxiety.

# Papers Of The Week

1. **[DynIBaR: Neural Dynamic Image-Based Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11082?utm_source=marktechpost-newsletter.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ai-news-best-ai-papers-from-cvpr-2023)**

    A research team from Google Research and Cornell Tech have put forward an intriguing paper, introducing a novel method for synthesizing new views from a monocular video of a complex dynamic scene. Current methods, such as dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs), face challenges with long videos, complex object motions, and uncontrolled camera trajectories, often resulting in inaccurate or blurry renderings. In contrast, this research presents a volumetric image-based rendering framework, aggregating features from nearby views in a scene-motion-aware fashion. This approach not only models complex scenes and view-dependent effects but also synthesizes photo-realistic novel views from long videos with complex dynamics and unconstrained camera trajectories. The results reveal significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods and successful application to real-world videos with challenging camera and object motion. 

2. **[3D Registration with Maximal Cliques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10854?utm_source=marktechpost-newsletter.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=ai-news-best-ai-papers-from-cvpr-2023)**

   This study, by Northwestern Polytechnical University, China, showcases an innovative method for 3D point cloud registration (PCR), which involves aligning a pair of point clouds to pinpoint the optimal pose. Named Maximal Cliques (MAC), the technique uses maximal cliques in a graph to extract local consensus information and generate accurate pose hypotheses. The process consists of several steps, including constructing a compatibility graph, identifying maximal cliques, and computing transformation hypotheses. Thorough experiments on various benchmark datasets such as U3M, 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and KITTI revealed that MAC significantly boosts registration accuracy compared to leading methods, enhancing deep-learning-based approaches' performance. Combined with deep-learned methods, MAC achieved state-of-the-art registration recall on 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch. The findings illustrate MAC as a highly effective technique for 3D point cloud registration, surpassing existing methods in both accuracy and performance.

3. **[Fast Segment Anything](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.12156v1.pdf)**

   The recently proposed segment anything model (SAM) has made a significant influence in many computer vision tasks. It is becoming a foundation step for many high-level tasks, like image segmentation, image caption, and image editing. However, its huge computation costs prevent it from wider applications in industry scenarios. The computation mainly comes from the Transformer architecture at high-resolution inputs. In this paper, we propose a speed-up alternative method for this fundamental task with comparable performance. By reformulating the task as segments-generation and prompting, we find that a regular CNN detector with an instance segmentation branch can also accomplish this task well. Specifically, we convert this task to the well-studied instance segmentation task and directly train the existing instance segmentation method using only 1/50 of the SA-1B dataset published by SAM authors. With our method, we achieve a comparable performance with the SAM method at 50 times higher run-time speed. We give sufficient experimental results to demonstrate its effectiveness. The codes and demos will be released at https://github.com/CASIA-IVA-Lab/FastSAM.
