# Feature Stories

## Meta's Generative Play

Despite substantial investments in AI technologies, Meta has encountered obstacles in launching their high-profile generative AI initiative. Staff turnover, resource allocation challenges, and the lingering effects of past controversies have posed significant hurdles. To address these issues, Meta is currently undergoing a reorganization and has ambitious plans to roll out new generative AI products. They are also establishing a dedicated AI group aimed at overcoming these challenges and advancing the field of generative AI.

## Fine-Tuning Neural Networks

At Stanford, researchers have achieved a groundbreaking advancement in neural networks through a method known as 'surgical fine-tuning.' By specifically modifying layers based on the disparity between fine-tuning data and pre-training data, they have achieved remarkable improvements in network performance. This innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize the field of neural network optimization and further enhance the capabilities of AI systems.

## OpenAI Makes GPT-4 Generally Available

OpenAI has set new standards with the release of GPT-4, which is now generally available to the public. This advanced language model surpasses its predecessor, GPT-3.5, offering significantly improved capabilities. GPT-4 is expected to revolutionize AI applications across a wide range of domains, from natural language understanding to creative content generation. The enhanced performance and versatility of GPT-4 mark a significant milestone in the evolution of language models.

## ChatGPT Traffic Decline

As the novelty factor begins to wane, the worldwide desktop and mobile web traffic to the ChatGPT website saw a slight decline of 9.7% from May to June. The United States experienced a slightly higher drop of 10.3%. However, it is noteworthy that ChatGPT continues to attract more global visitors than Microsoft's search engine, Bing. This decline in traffic highlights the evolving dynamics of user engagement with AI-driven conversational platforms.

## AI Regulation in Washington

In a move to foster a deeper understanding of AI regulation among legislators, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has unveiled the SAFE Innovation program. This program includes nonpartisan sessions with industry professionals and experts to balance the promotion of AI innovation with safeguarding public interest. By facilitating informed discussions, the program aims to shape AI regulations that foster responsible and ethical AI development while promoting technological progress.

## U.S. Tightens Export Controls on AI Chips to China

The Biden administration has recently implemented restrictions on the sale of specific AI chips, including Nvidia's A800, to China. This policy represents an effort to control China's rapid technological progress and safeguard national security interests. The tightening of export controls underscores the geopolitical implications of advanced AI technologies and the evolving dynamics of AI competition on a global scale.

# Paper of the Week: DisCo: Disentangled Control for Referring Human Dance Generation in Real World

This week, we feature an extraordinary paper titled "DisCo: Disentangled Control for Referring Human Dance Generation in Real World." Published on June 30th, 2023, by a team including Tan Wang, Linjie Li, Kevin Lin, Chung-Ching Lin, Zhengyuan Yang, Hanwang Zhang, Zicheng Liu, and Lijuan Wang, this groundbreaking research sets a new milestone in the field of generative AI.

Dance synthesis has long been a challenging task, particularly in generating human-centric content that accurately represents real-world dance scenarios. Existing methods often struggle to bridge the gap between synthesized content and the intricacies of genuine dance movements. This paper introduces a novel approach called "Referring Human Dance Generation," which focuses on real-world dance scenarios with three essential properties: faithfulness, generalizability, and compositionality.

The researchers propose DISCO, a groundbreaking approach that utilizes a unique model architecture with disentangled control to enhance the faithfulness and compositionality of dance synthesis. Additionally, an innovative human attribute pre-training method improves the generalizability of the model to unseen humans. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that DISCO can generate high-quality human dance images and videos with diverse appearances and flexible motions.
