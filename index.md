Greetings! I am thrilled to welcome you to my professional corner of the internet. I am Drew Levin, a driven undergraduate student at the esteemed University of Wisconsin-Madison, majoring in the ever-evolving fields of Computer Science and Data Science.

My academic interests are broad yet deep, with a special penchant for machine learning and data science. While I firmly believe in the transformational power of AI, I remain grounded in my understanding that AI cannot yet emulate human empathy or emotions, keeping my expectations realistic and grounded. Nevertheless, I am confident that the growing applications of machine learning will continue to reshape various sectors across the globe. I take immense pride in my expertise in Python and am a staunch advocate of open-source technology.

My career has taken me from co-founding and innovating in AI at Ornamynt in London, to my current role at CAI. At Ornamynt, I developed AI applications and consulted with leading advertisers. Now at CAI, I leverage machine learning to solve a variety of problems for our organization and clients, generating tangible improvements.

Outside my professional sphere, I am an avid reader, immersing myself in diverse genres and writers to widen my worldview. I also value my time spent with friends, cherishing the camaraderie and deep relationships that we share. Equally, I am invigorated by the thrill of problem-solving, whether it's intricate coding challenges or sophisticated puzzles. It brings me great joy to unravel complexities and design efficient solutions.

Please regard this blog as a professional logbook, showcasing my thoughts, experiences, projects, and intellectual explorations. When I engage in independent learning, I often find myself diving into a multitude of captivating subjects. Consequently, this blog offers an eclectic mix of topics. Nonetheless, it's my sincere wish that you'll derive as much pleasure reading my posts as I do writing them!
