Hello there! Welcome to my personal space on the internet. I'm Drew Levin, an ambitious undergraduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I'm focusing on Computer Science and Data Science.

My interests cover a wide range but are deeply rooted. My focus is particularly inclined towards machine learning and data science. However, I harbor no illusions about AI matching human capabilities in understanding empathy or emotions, an outlook that roots me in realism rather than unfounded optimism. That said, I am certain that the advancements and applications of machine learning can make significant contributions to various domains globally. I take particular pride in my proficiency with Python and stand as a firm supporter of open-source technology.

One of the most impactful experiences in my life has been my tenure as a Co-Founder and Machine Learning Engineer at Ornamynt in London, where I developed innovative AI-based service applications. My responsibilities ranged from collaborating with machine learning PhDs to create new AI applications, to consulting with major advertising companies and enhancing their client services through AI solutions.

In my leisure time, I am an enthusiastic reader, immersing myself in a variety of genres and authors to broaden my perspectives. Spending time with friends is another pastime that I cherish, as I believe in nurturing strong relationships and enjoying the simple pleasures of camaraderie. I'm also driven by the thrill of problem-solving, whether that's a complex coding challenge or a mind-bending puzzle. I take immense satisfaction in untangling complexities and finding efficient solutions. 

Consider this blog as a diary of sorts, a collection of my thoughts, experiences, projects, and explorations. When I learn independently, I often find myself venturing down numerous fascinating rabbit holes, so I hope you're prepared for a wide array of topics in this blog. Nonetheless, I hope you find reading my posts as enjoyable as I find writing them!
