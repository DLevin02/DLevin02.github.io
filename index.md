I am thrilled to welcome you to my professional corner of the internet. I am Drew Levin, currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning at Columbia University. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Data Science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

My academic interests are both broad and deep, with a special focus on machine learning and data science. While I firmly believe in the transformative power of AI, I remain grounded in the understanding that AI cannot yet emulate human empathy or emotions, keeping my expectations realistic. Nevertheless, I am confident that the growing applications of machine learning will continue to reshape various sectors across the globe. I take immense pride in my expertise in Python and am a staunch advocate of open-source technology.

My career has taken me from co-founding and innovating at SideShift, a startup recognized for its innovative job matching approach using NLP, to developing Prebar, a global connectivity app for students abroad. At SideShift, I led the development of AI-driven solutions to optimize job matching for small businesses and students, securing pre-seed investment and achieving significant milestones. Additionally, my internships at Ornamynt and CAI allowed me to work on impactful machine learning projects, demonstrating my ability to apply advanced techniques to enhance operational efficiency.

Outside my professional sphere, I am an avid reader, immersing myself in diverse genres and writers to widen my worldview. I also value my time spent with friends, cherishing the camaraderie and deep relationships we share. Equally, I am invigorated by the thrill of problem-solving, whether it’s intricate coding challenges or sophisticated puzzles. It brings me great joy to unravel complexities and design efficient solutions.

Please regard this blog as a professional logbook, showcasing my thoughts, experiences, projects, and intellectual explorations. When I engage in independent learning, I often find myself diving into a multitude of captivating subjects. Consequently, this blog offers an eclectic mix of topics. I hope you’ll derive as much pleasure reading my posts as I do writing them!
